APIS for the project Geekstat

the APIS hosted are:
generating cf user file
recommending questions based on user stats

generating cf user file
call the api on the url+"/genuser/"+cf_username
suggesting questions
call the api on the url+"/recommendq/"+cf_username
the api call automatically generates userfile, so it isnt necessary to call userfile
